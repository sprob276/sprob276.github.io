            <h2>Parkinson's Disease</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Parkinson’s disease is a type of neurodegenerative disorder, which impacts the brain, and then effects the nervous system which are nerve cells in your body that controls movement. Parkinson’s directly impacts these nerve cells which impacts your ability to control your body and can cause uncontrollable movements. Progression gets worse as you age, and it can impair your ability to walk or talk. </p> 
            <p>Since Parkinson’s disease impacts your brain, as progression increases, it can also impact behaviour, memory, and cognitive functions. Parkinson’s disease generally impacts individuals around the age of 60 and risk gradually increase after that. Early on-set Parkinson’s disease is before the age of 50, with only around 5-10% of people are diagnosed. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="symptoms">
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>
                Symptoms vary for everyone, and it is not noticeable at onset of disease. Symptoms gradually get worse over time, and most commonly starts on one side of the body and slowly impacts the entire body, while still being worse on the original side it started on. These are the most common symptoms:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Tremors:</b> shaking is the most common symptom and usually involves shaking in fingers and hands. It can happen to other parts of the body too, and it can get worse in times of stress.</li>
                    <li><b>Rigid Muscles:</b> some muscles may be stiff in your body and can become painful.</li>
                    <li><b>Trouble speaking:</b> since Parkinson’s affect the nerve cells, it can affect facial muscles, which makes people speak more quietly or less often. They might also slur their words or not finish their sentences since it impacts their brain related to memory or thinking.</li>
                    <li><b>Decrease in automatic movement:</b> with the combination of Parkinson’s impacting brain function and movement, some automatic moving such as blinking may not happen as often.</li>
                    <li><b>Slower movement:</b> impacts your ability to move fast, making it harder to complete daily tasks.</li>
                    <li><b>Other non-movement related symptoms</b> other symptoms such as mental health problems occur and will be discussed below.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <section id="regions-affected">
            <h3>Regions of the Brain Affected</h3>
            <p>Parkinson’s disease is neurological, meaning it impacts the nerve cells of the brain. The area affected in which these cells are affected is in the basal ganglia.

            <p>The basal ganglia is a part of the brain that is associated with the control of movement. It is linked with your nerve cells that are associated with controlling movements towards your joints. It sends signals from your brain to your body, through the spine towards your muscles, in order to execute movement. If the signal is rejected, it goes into an area of the brain where it suppresses the signal.</p>
            <p>Parkinson’s disease directly impacts the nerve cells in the basal ganglia, causing them to disappear. This area of the brain is also associated with non-declarative memory, which is a type of long-term memory that is nonconscious. Contrast to what people believe in, nondeclarative memory is complex but comes easily to people, as it is stuff that we do automatically. Since movement is a type of non-declarative memory and happens automatically, the basal ganglia is associated with movement, and when impacted it is linked with your nerve cells and impairs your ability to control your movement.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="causes">
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>The main cause of Parkinson’s disease is the loss of neurons in the brain, specifically located within the basal ganglia. These neurons die over time as they are broken down, and these neurons produce dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, which is a messenger that forms communication between your brain and body which is responsible for the movement but also memory and mood. Parkinson’s affects this neurotransmitter and when dopamine is lost, all those functions are impacted. The cause of these neuron losses is still unknown.</p>
            <p>Another messenger called norepinephrine is also lost, which is responsible for our body’s response to stress and mainly affects blood pressure. When this is lost it causes abnormal blood pressure and impacts how food is digested. On top of already putting a lot of stress on the joints, movement is also impacted by this abnormal blood pressure as people get extremely tired or dizzy when they try to move suddenly. </p>
            <p>The main causes are unknown but there are some factors that seem to be linked with the development of Parkinson’s disease:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Hereditary:</b> it is known that Parkinson’s disease is gene related and that if some family members have had Parkinson’s disease, then you are more likely to get it, but it is still not the main cause.</li>
                <li><b>Age:</b> mentioned earlier, age is the most common cause of Parkinson’s disease as people over the age of 50 are at most risk.</li>
                <li><b>Gender:</b> males are most likely to have Parkinson’s disease. </li>
                <li><b>Exposure to chemicals:</b> there have been cases that showed factors from the environment have played a role such as constant exposure to different substances or chemicals.</li>
            </ul>
        
        </section>
        <section id="mental-health">
            <h2>Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Moving onto the non-motor symptoms, Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease and impacts not only the motor aspect of the brain but also mental health. People with Parkinson’s disease are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, or psychosis. They are more likely to experience mood swings and have an even greater affect on how they live life. Since Parkinson’s disease impact movement, people and even doctors are more likely to ignore and not realize the mental health aspect of it. As mentioned earlier dopamine is involved with controlling mood, which impacts other functions such as how much sleep we get. When there is a loss of dopamine, the increase of mental illnesses is increased significantly. The loss of dopamine affects motivation to do anything, and when it is lost in the brain that is responsible for movement it becomes extremely hard to move on top of the pain. This creates even more symptoms such as being tired or feeling sad.</p>

        <section id="impact-of-exercise">
            <h1>Impact of Exercise & Recommendations</h1>
            <h3>How exercise impacts Parkinson's</h3>
            <p>Exercise seems to be impactful for everyone, but it is significant for people with Parkinson’s. As there is no way to fully prevent Parkinson’s disease from occurring, exercise can help decrease the progression of the disease. Since Parkinson’s disease impact the brain function and contributes the loss of neurons and the loss of dopamine and norepinephrine, we cannot stop the loss of those neurons, but we can help strengthen them and help create new connections by exercising. The new connections can help by ratioing the lost connections with the new ones and therefore slowing down disease progression.</p>
            <p>There have been many studies conducted for people with early onset of Parkinson’s disease in order to examine the relationship between exercise and Parkinson’s disease. Many of these studies have shown that disease progression is significantly decreased comparing to those who do not exercise as often. The most impactful form of exercise is high intensity aerobic exercise such as running on the treadmill or biking. A certain study has looked at patients with early onset Parkinson’s disease and exercising 3 times a week for half a year (Fields, 2024). By comparing patients who did not exercise as often, it showed that progression of the disease was significantly reduced for those individuals who exercised that often (Fields, 2024). </p>
        
            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <p>There are specific exercises that are beneficial for people with Parkinson’s disease and is most effective at early onset in order to help combat neurodegeneration. With the recommendations from Dr. Tinaz, who is a Medicine neurologist at Yale, there are different exercises in combating Parkinson’s (Fields, 2024).</p>

                <p>Muhammad Ali was a professional boxing athlete and has passed away after fighting a battle against Parkinson’s. He was one of the first prominent figures to raise awareness about it because of the legacy he created. He has battled with it for over 30 years, and his symptoms were highlighted in the media. Some symptoms he displayed were troubles speaking or poor posture During his fighting days, he continued to fight as his symptoms got worse and were potentially ignored by professionals as he was not diagnosed until a couple of years after he retired. His family had expressed their concerns over his movement behaviours as they have noticed his behaviour changed over the course of his career. He was impacted at an early age compared to the normal onset of Parkinson’s disease. He was showing symptoms during his career but was not diagnosed until he retired in his early 40s, which is already extremely early for a diagnosis.</p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>His journey was important to highlighting how symptoms are presented. Muhammad Ali was an extremely fit athlete, which did not correlate to the evidence of exercising decreasing early onset of Parkinson’s disease. His case made many people reevaluate his career and symptoms as recent as this decade. His career led to the conclusion that head trauma can have an influence on the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. </p>
